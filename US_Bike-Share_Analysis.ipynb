    "\n",
    "Before looking at the bike sharing data, you should start by asking questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? If you were a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how you would want to use the service?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: Write at least two questions related to bike sharing that you think could be answered by data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 1**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Q1. How many people travel from place A to place B by walking where bicycle-sharing system isn't installed? \n",
    "- Q2. How many people from them are willing to use our service? \n",
    "- Q3. How many of our users use subscription service? And how many dont? \n",
    "- Q4. How many of our users want to Subscribe to our service but is a little bit expensive to them?"

    "**Question 2**: However, there is still a lot of data for us to investigate, so it's a good idea to start off by looking at one entry from each of the cities we're going to analyze. Run the first code cell below to load some packages and functions that you'll be using in your analysis. Then, complete the second code cell to print out the first trip recorded from each of the cities (the second line of each data file).\n",

To make things as simple as possible when we get to the actual exploration, we should trim and clean the data.

    "- **Month**, **Hour**, **Day of Week**: Ridership volume is likely to change based on the season, time of day, and whether it is a weekday or weekend. Use the start time of the trip to obtain these values. The New York City data includes the seconds in their timestamps, while Washington and Chicago do not. The [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) package will be very useful here to make the needed conversions.\n",
    "- **User Type**: It is possible that users who are subscribed to a bike-share system will have different patterns of use compared to users who only have temporary passes. Washington divides its users into two types: 'Registered' for users with annual, monthly, and other longer-term subscriptions, and 'Casual', for users with 24-hour, 3-day, and other short-term passes. The New York and Chicago data uses 'Subscriber' and 'Customer' for these groups, respectively. For consistency, you will convert the Washington labels to match the other two.\n",

    "- Subcribers graph shows bimodal type of distributions, which means subscribers choose to ride bikes a lot somewhere between 7 hours to 9 hours and a lot between 17 hours to 19 hours. The bike rides are really low at time between 0 - 5 hours. Rest of the day the use is steady.\n",

    "- Customers graph has a somewhat normal distribution. This means Customers use lots of bikes in between daytime as you can see between 12-17. The only similarity in the graph of subscribers and customers is that there's less alot less use of bikes between 0-5 hours."

    "Congratulations on completing the project! This is only a sampling of the data analysis process: from generating questions, wrangling the data, and to exploring the data. Normally, at this point in the data analysis process, you might want to draw conclusions about the data by performing a statistical test or fitting the data to a model for making predictions. There are also a lot of potential analyses that could be performed on the data which are not possible with only the data provided. For example, detailed location data has not been investigated. Where are the most commonly used docks? What are the most common routes? As another example, weather has potential to have a large impact on daily ridership. How much is ridership impacted when there is rain or snow? Are subscribers or customers affected more by changes in weather?\n",

    "**Question 7**: Putting the bike share data aside, think of a topic or field of interest where you would like to be able to apply the techniques of data science. What would you like to be able to learn from your chosen subject?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: I would actually use this in the field of finance. Capturing and analyzing new sources of data, building predictive models."
