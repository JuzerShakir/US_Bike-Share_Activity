    "\n",
    "Before looking at the bike sharing data, you should start by asking questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? If you were a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how you would want to use the service?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: Write at least two questions related to bike sharing that you think could be answered by data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 1**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Q1. How many people travel from place A to place B by walking where bicycle-sharing system isn't installed? \n",
    "- Q2. How many people from them are willing to use our service? \n",
    "- Q3. How many of our users use subscription service? And how many dont? \n",
    "- Q4. How many of our users want to Subscribe to our service but is a little bit expensive to them?"

    "**Question 2**: However, there is still a lot of data for us to investigate, so it's a good idea to start off by looking at one entry from each of the cities we're going to analyze. Run the first code cell below to load some packages and functions that you'll be using in your analysis. Then, complete the second code cell to print out the first trip recorded from each of the cities (the second line of each data file).\n",

To make things as simple as possible when we get to the actual exploration, we should trim and clean the data.

Use the start time of the trip to obtain these values. The New York City data includes the seconds in their timestamps, while Washington and Chicago do not. The [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) package will be very useful here to make the needed conversions.\n",
    "- **User Type**: It is possible that users who are subscribed to a bike-share system will have different patterns of use compared to users who only have temporary passes. Washington divides its users into two types: 'Registered' for users with annual, monthly, and other longer-term subscriptions, and 'Casual', for users with 24-hour, 3-day, and other short-term passes. The New York and Chicago data uses 'Subscriber' and 'Customer' for these groups, respectively. For consistency, you will convert the Washington labels to match the other two.\n",

    "So far, you've performed an initial exploration into the data available. You have compared the relative volume of trips made between three U.S. cities and the ratio of trips made by Subscribers and Customers. For one of these cities, you have investigated differences between Subscribers and Customers in terms of how long a typical trip lasts. Now it is your turn to continue the exploration in a direction that you choose. Here are a few suggestions for questions to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does ridership differ by month or season? Which month / season has the highest ridership? Does the ratio of Subscriber trips to Customer trips change depending on the month or season?\n",
    "- Is the pattern of ridership different on the weekends versus weekdays? On what days are Subscribers most likely to use the system? What about Customers? Does the average duration of rides change depending on the day of the week?\n",
    "- During what time of day is the system used the most? Is there a difference in usage patterns for Subscribers and Customers?\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of the questions you posed in your answer to question 1 align with the bullet points above, this is a good opportunity to investigate one of them. As part of your investigation, you will need to create a visualization. If you want to create something other than a histogram, then you might want to consult the [Pyplot documentation](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/pyplot_summary.html). In particular, if you are plotting values across a categorical variable (e.g. city, user type), a bar chart will be useful. The [documentation page for `.bar()`](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.bar.html#matplotlib.pyplot.bar) includes links at the bottom of the page with examples for you to build off of for your own use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 6**: Continue the investigation by exploring another question that could be answered by the data available. Document the question you want to explore below. Your investigation should involve at least two variables and should compare at least two groups. You should also use at least one visualization as part of your explorations.\n",

    "Congratulations on completing the project! This is only a sampling of the data analysis process: from generating questions, wrangling the data, and to exploring the data. Normally, at this point in the data analysis process, you might want to draw conclusions about the data by performing a statistical test or fitting the data to a model for making predictions. There are also a lot of potential analyses that could be performed on the data which are not possible with only the data provided. For example, detailed location data has not been investigated. Where are the most commonly used docks? What are the most common routes? As another example, weather has potential to have a large impact on daily ridership. How much is ridership impacted when there is rain or snow? Are subscribers or customers affected more by changes in weather?\n",
